 <h1>Menu Applet</h1>

 </ul>

 
 <p>I was just developping my own class, and I has the idea to
 have, in my left frame, a menu system. I am an OO consultant, my
 first idea was <strong>Reusage</strong>: ok; a couple of visits to
 <em>Gamelan</em> and <em>Jars</em>, and no doubt, there were some
 applets I could have used. The problem is that the source code was
 not available, and I would have liked to touch those applets, I
 wanted to have my own design, and, more important, I had some
 time.</p>

 <p>Finally, I have more problems developping it, but I really like
 the result, you can see it at the bottom of this page. </p>

 <p>It is very simple, but is very easy to modify its look
 because:</p>

 <ul type="square">
  <li>It draws the image you pass it as a parameter: just change
  the image, and you will have a new look.</li>

  <li>The <strong>source code</strong> is available. Just a
  condition: if you modify it and get a better result, please send
  me your solution.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h2><a name="source" id="source">The source code</a></h2>

 <p>The idea for this applet is very simple: having two images for
 each menu item, and just draw one of them depending on the user
 selection. Therefore, it is some work on graphics and to get the
 mouse events, more or less.</p>
 <p>But:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>To speed it up, it is needed to load one image only, and not
  one for each item in the menu. But to split an image is not
  directly supported in the awt, and I have had to develop my own
  SplitImage class.</li>

  <li>The event model has changed in the JDK 1.1; therefore, my
  nice 1.1 class didn't work on any of the current browsers, and I
  have to use the deprecated API. That's the reason because some
  parts of the code are inside comments: is the JDK 1.1 compliant
  part.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>The SplitImage class allows to split an image in as many parts
 as the user decides, all of them with the same size. The
 implementation of this applet could have been much simpler, using
 the class PixelGrabber, whose purpose is to retrieve an image, or
 a part of it as a map of bytes, but, I don't know yet the reason,
 this class was not properly working (??). This class is slightly
 better described on its <a href="../splitimage/index.htm">own
 page</a>.</p>

 <p>Therefore, this class is an ImageConsumer, that receives the
 list of pixels, and construct as many ImageProducers as needed
 (for this, it has properly worked the class MemoryImageSource).</p>

 <p>And here is finally the source code:</p>

 <ul>
  <li><a href="Menu.java">Menu.java</a> (7 KB)</li>

  <li><a href="../splitimage/SplitImage.java">SplitImage.java</a>
  (6 KB)</li>
 </ul>

 <h2><a name="parameters" id="parameters">Applet
 parameters</a></h2>

 <ul>
  <li>frame : [optional] the frame to use to lunch the URL</li>

  <li>items : [mandatory] number of items in the menu</li>

  <li>image : [mandatory] the image (jpg or gif) that represents
  the menu. If the applet has a size of (width x height), the image
  should have, although this is not checked, the size (2*width x
  height). The left side of the image contains the menu in its
  normal state, and the right side, in its highlighted state. See
  the example, for more details. <em>Note:it is much better to use
  gif images, because the applet uses the RGB color model</em></li>

  <li>For each item, it is also mandatory to give a parameter
  called 'dst%', with the destin URL.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2><a name="example" id="example">An example</a></h2>

 <p>First, it is needed to create the image (just have time
 enough!)
 </p>
 <img src="workmenu.jpg" class='centered'>

 <p>This image can be used with the following html:</p>
 <pre class='code'>
          &lt;APPLET CODE=Menu.class WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80&gt;

          &lt;param name=image value="img/ownmenu.gif"&gt;
          &lt;param name=items value=3&gt;
          &lt;param name=dst1 value="virtualnet/virtualnet.htm"&gt;
          &lt;param name=dst2 value="menu/menu.htm"&gt;
          &lt;param name=dst3 value="filesplit/filesplit.htm"&gt;
          &lt;param name=frame value="main"&gt;

          &lt;/APPLET&gt;
</pre>

 <p>And here it is the applet in action:</p>

 <applet code="Menu.class" width="150" height="120">
  <param name="image" value="workmenu.jpg">
  <param name="items" value="3">
  <param name="dst1" value="../virtualnet/index.htm">
  <param name="dst2" value="index.htm">
  <param name="dst3" value="../filesplit/index.htm">
  <img src="halfMenuB.jpg">
 </applet>
