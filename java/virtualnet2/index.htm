 <p><span class='mark'>VirtualNet<span class=
 'markp'>2</span></span> is an application that simulates a network
 on a standalone computer.</p>

 <p>A CORBA application -by introducing <strong>one</strong> line
 of code before initializing the ORB- uses automatically the
 VirtualNet: it is hosted on one of the virtual computers, and its
 communications with other CORBA objects are only possible as far
 as there is any valid virtual path to its host.</p>

 <p>It works with any application CORBA, and with any ORB
 implementing interceptors. I have succesfully used it with the Sun
 ORB included with JDK1.4, Orbacus 4 and Jacorb 1.4. The
 application is written in Java, but the application using the
 virtual net can be written on any language, provided it has a
 CORBA mapping.</p>

 <h2><a name="History" id="History">History</a></h2>

 <p>This application is the evolution of <a href=
 "../virtualnet/index.htm">VirtualNet</a>, an application I
 designed in 1997 to be able to simulate a network topology on a
 single computer. Using most of the communication systems, being
 sockets, JavaRMI, CORBA, etc, allows the testing of the
 application on just one computer, but this test lacks the problems
 that happen on real cases on a network, like:</p>

 <ul compact type="disc">
  <li>Slower communications: delays</li>

  <li>Problems on links, giving way to unreachable nodes</li>
 </ul>

 <p>On the first approach, VirtualNet only worked with JavaRMI,
 replacing the <strong>rmiregistry</strong>. It had its own
 compiler, parallel to the <strong>rmic</strong> compiler, to
 create stubs and skeletons that intercepted the communications,
 and checked when that communication was possible and which delay
 had it associated. Although the approach was quite transparent,
 the application still had to change slightly the code, but the
 main drawback was that JavaRMI applications not using the registry
 could not take advantage of the application. And I never tried to
 change the application to simulate the more advanced capabilities
 included in JavaRMI with Java2.</p>

 <p><span class='mark'>VirtualNet<span class=
 'markp'>2</span></span> works only over CORBA, using 
 <strong>interceptors</strong>. It has two parts, the server,
 written in Java, which creates the virtual net. It has a nice
 graphical interface, lets the user to modify the virtual net on
 any moment, and listens on a specific port for virtual paths
 checking. The protocol to check for virtual paths is very simple,
 easy to implement on any language.</p>

 <p>The client part is so far written on Java, but I'm now written
 as well a C++ client. The interesting client is a CORBA
 interceptor that automatically accesses the VirtualNet to verify
 wether the target node is reachable or not. If it's not reachable,
 a CORBA COMM_FAILURE exception is raised, simulating completely
 the real case behaviour. This checking is done twice: when the
 remote object is accessed, and when the answer is sent.</p>

 <h2><a name="CreateAVirtualNet" id="CreateAVirtualNet">Create a
 virtual net</a></h2>

 <p>The server program is conceptvnet2.VirtualNetconcept, which can
 be invoked (attention to the classpath) as:</p>
 <pre>
java vnet2.VirtualNet
</pre>This application has several command line
 <pre>
Use [-help] [-nograph] [-verbose] [-port=xxx] file
</pre>

 <p>The <em>-nograph</em> option is interesting to launch existing
 virtual nets without a graphical interface.</p>

 <p>To create a virtual net, it is needed to give a port, where it
 will listen for client requests. At any moment, the graphical
 interface lets the user save or load any other virtual net.</p>

 <p>To create nodes, links, etc, there is currently just one
 possibility: go to NetLayout-&gt;Modify, and introduce an string
 with the modifications. I have been working on a nice interface to
 make it easier, but I really find the current input quite
 flexible. For example, to create a node 'A', a node 'B', and a
 link '1' between them, the input is:</p>
 <pre>
+A+B+A&lt;1&gt;B
</pre>

 <p>Following are the sintactic rules:</p>

 <ol compact>
  <li>A node or a link is specified by a string that contains no
  spaces or any of the following characters: '-', '+', '&lt;',
  '&gt;', '(', ')','/'</li>

  <li>A node is created by prepending the character '+' to the name
  of the node. For example: <strong>+Machine_1</strong></li>

  <li>To remove a node, the same notation as to created is used,
  but using the character '-'. For example
  <strong>-Machine_1</strong></li>

  <li>A node can de activated/deactivated temporary using '+.' or
  '-.' For example <strong>-.Machine_1</strong></li>

  <li>A link is created specifying '+', the first node, then a
  character '&lt;', the link id, again a character '&gt;' and then
  the second node. For example:
  <strong>+Machine_1&lt;link1&gt;Machine_2</strong>. To do the link
  unidirectional, use '&lt;' before the second node:
  <strong>+Machine_1&lt;link1&lt;Machine_2</strong></li>

  <li>A link is removed specifying '-&lt;' before the node name,
  like <strong>-&lt;link1</strong></li>

  <li>A link can de activated/deactivated temporary using '+.' or
  '-.;. For example <strong>-.&lt;link1</strong></li>

  <li>delays (in millseconds) can be specified to nodes or links by
  appending to its name "(delay)", on creation. For example:
  <strong>+Node(100)</strong> or
  <strong>+Node&lt;Link(100)&gt;OtherNode</strong></li>

  <li>A node delay can be changed using /node(delay), like in
  <strong>/node(100)</strong></li>

  <li>A link delay can be changed using /&lt;link(delay), like in
  <strong>/&lt;link(100)</strong></li>

  <li>The delay for every link can be changed using /&lt;(delay),
  like <strong>/&lt;(100)</strong></li>

  <li>Every node delay can be changed using /(delay), like in
  <strong>/(100)</strong></li>

  <li>In the previous cases, if the delay is not specified, default
  values are assumed</li>

   <p>For example:</p>
   <pre>
+ A + B + C + D + E + A&lt;1&gt;B + A&lt;5&gt;D + B&lt;2&gt;C
</pre>
   <pre>
+ B&lt;10&gt;E + E&lt;11&gt;D + C&lt;3&gt;D + C&lt;20&lt;E
</pre>

   <p>Creates the next layout:</p>
   <img src="createA.gif" class='centered border' alt="original layout">

   <p>It is possible to move around the nodes and the links, to get
   a clearer picture:</p>
   <img src="createB.gif" class='centered border' alt="moved layout">

   <p>Using the mouse, it is possible to activate / deactivate or
   destroy the nodes and links. Following are the used
   icons:</p>
   
   <table>
   <tr><td><img src="nodeActive.gif"></td><td>Node active</td>
	   <td><img src="nodeDeactivated.gif"></td><td>Node deactivated</td>
       <td><img src="nodeInUse.gif"></td><td>Node in use</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td><img src="linkActive.gif"></td><td>Link active</td>
		<td><img src="linkDeactivated.gif"></td><td>Link deactivated</td>
        <td><img src="linkInUse.gif"></td><td>Link in use</td>
	</tr>
    <tr><td><img src="linkMonoActive.gif"></td><td>Link mono active</td>
		<td><img src="linkMonoDeactivated.gif"></td><td>Link mono deactivated</td>
        <td><img src="linkMonoInUse.gif"></td><td>Link mono in use</td>
    </tr></table>
   
   

 <h2><a name="UseVirtualNet" id="UseVirtualNet">Use the virtual
 net</a></h2>

 <p>The server program is located in the package
 <strong>vnet2</strong>, but not so the client side. There are
 several reasons for it. The first is that any application can use
 the virtual net as a client, and the second one, that the client
 does not have to be written in Java</p>

 <p>Said this, the package <em>vnet2user</em> contains a client
 that implements the interceptor behaviour for CORBA.</p>

 <p>On Java, the ORB is usually initialized with:</p>
 <pre>
ORB orb = ORB.init(args, props);
</pre>

 <p>Where <em>args</em> are the command line arguments and
 <em>props</em> the list of properties, as a
 <em>java.util.Properties</em>. Before doing this step, it can be
 written:</p>
 <pre>
args=vnet2user.Interceptor.setup(user, args, props);
</pre>

 <p>This method installs the interceptor, using some of the
 arguments. It expects the following arguments:</p>

 <ul compact>
  <li><strong>-virtualHostName</strong>: the name of the virtual
  host where this ORB is to be simulated. It must exist on the
  virtual net, and it is mandatory.</li>

  <li><strong>-virtualNetHost</strong>: the name of the host
  containing the virtual net. It is the local host by default</li>

  <li><strong>-virtualNetPort</strong>: the port where the virtual
  net is installed. It is mandatory</li>
 </ul>
 <p>When the interceptor reads the arguments, it returns another
 list of arguments where the virtualNet arguments are excluded. If
 some of the mandatory parameters is not present, the program is
 executed without using the virtual net.</p>

 <p>The first argument for <strong>setup</strong> is an object
 implementing the interface <em>vnet2user.InterceptorUser</em>,
 which receives any message from the interceptor. It can be null,
 but in that case any error is dumped on the normal output, and the
 program exited.</p>

 <p>The distribution includes a client/server program, a counter,
 showing the use of this interceptor.</p>

 <p>Another interceptor for C++ will be included shortly.</p>

 <h2><a name="ClientProtocol" id="ClientProtocol">Client
 protocol</a></h2>

 <p><em>Note that this section is not needed to use the
 application</em></p>

 <p>The package <em>vnet2user</em> includes as well a program
 called <em>TestClient</em> that shows the client protocol. This
 program requires a virtual host name, and then verifies wether
 there is a virtual path to any other host.</p>

 <p>The VirtualNet server listens continuosly on a port, where the
 client can request wether a virtual path is possible. This path is
 calculated every time, applying the delays that have been
 specified for each node and link: this process can be observed on
 the screen, as the icons change their colour.</p>

 <p>To work, the virtualNet server stablishes a session for each
 client:</p>

 <ol>
  <li>It receives the name of the node to host; this node is
  specified as an array of bytes, holding the first byte the number
  of bytes to read. The node name must be in UTF-8 format:
  byte?order specified by a mandatory initial byte-order mark.</li>

  <li>A byte is returned. Return value can be 0 to indicate success
  or FF to indicate error. In this case, a return value of FF means
  that the node given is not existing in the current netlayout.
  This is not a real error, further requests are still valid.</li>

  <li>After this session is started, each new request must just
  contain the target node, and the return value will indicate
  wether there is a virtual path bertween both nodes or not.</li>

  <li>The format for the request is the same as for the session
  creation, now including just the target node name (UTF-8...)</li>

  <li>The return value contains 0 if a path exists and FF if not.
  This specification can change to show some extended information
  about the error. For example FE could mean that there is no
  virtual path because the target node does not exist, etc.
  Anycase, a value 0 will always means success and any other value
  is an error flag</li>
 </ol>

 <h2><a name="VersionAndBugs" id="VersionAndBugs">Version and
 bugs</a></h2>

 <p>Current version is 0.3; it works without problems, although it
 contains some minor errors that I will solve as soon as
 possible:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>If a node is destroyed, its links are destroyed as well. But
  if there is a monodirectional link <strong>to</strong> the node,
  that link stays, and must be destroyed separately. The server is
  still able to calculate correctly paths, it is only the screen
  that looks <em>bad</em></li>

  <li>Once a server is shutdown (virtualnet is closed), if a new
  one is going to be created, the applications keeps on asking if
  the current virtual net (which one?) must be saved.</li>

  <li>It does not update the display on the Swing thread, resulting
  in refresh problems. This is the most awful problem (at least it
  does not always appear).</li>

  <li>The interceptors does not behave correctly if the VirtualNet
  server is shutdown.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>In addition, the C++ interceptor will be included with the next
 version.</p>

 </ul>

 <h2><a name="Example" id="Example">Example</a></h2>

 <p>To see the following example, it is required to download the
 <em>jar</em> files shown on the <a href=
 "#LicenseAndDownload">previous section</a>, plus the following 2
 files:</p>

 <ul type="disc">
  <li>A virtual net layout (text file): <a href=

  <li>The example in binary format (.jar, 24 KB): <a href=
  "counter.jar">counter.jar</a></li>
 </ul>

 <p>You can download as well the source for the example (9 KB):
 <a href="counter.zip">counter.zip</a>.</p>

 <p>The first step is to start the virtual net server. This can be
 done with:</p>
 <pre>
java -jar vnet2.jar example.vnet
</pre>

 <p>This should show a netlayout like the shown before, with some
 nodes and links deactivated. This example uses the port 3456.</p>

 <p>Now, the server of the example is started. Please introduce the
 next info (just one line), which contacts with the virtual net on
 the port <strong>3456</strong>, and simulates the server on the
 node <strong>E</strong>. An additional argument is given, with the
 name of the server (a file is written with this name containing
 the server's reference).</p>
 <pre>
java -classpath vnet2.jar:vnet2user.jar:counter.jar counter.Server
     -virtualHostName E -virtualNetPort 3456 ServerExample
</pre>

 <p>One or more clients can now be started. Please introduce the
 next info (just one line), which contacts with the virtual net on
 the port <strong>3456</strong>, and simulates the client on the
 node <strong>A</strong>. An additional argument is given, with the
 name of the server.</p>
 <pre>
java -classpath vnet2.jar:vnet2user.jar:counter.jar counter.Client
     -virtualHostName A -virtualNetPort 3456 ServerExample
</pre>

 <p>On the layout given, I have included long delays; for this
 reason, any request can take much longuer than expected. It is
 possible to see on the screen the events on the net; try to
 deactivate any node or link to check that the client receives
 indeed the appropiated exception. Note on the source code that no
 special adaptations have been added (only the already mentioned
 one-line setup).</p>
