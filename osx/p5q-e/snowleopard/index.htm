<h1>Snow Leopard on Asus P5Q-E</h1>

<img src='sl-lu.png' alt='sl hackintosh image' class='left' />

<p align='right'>[<a href='#updates' class='right'>Info on software updates</a>]</p>

<p>This is my little help for anyone trying to install Snow Leopard OsX on P5Q-E 
(in fact, almost any Asus P5Q motherboard should work the same -sound apart-), 
whether it is a new install or an update from Leopard.</p>
 
<p>This is a continuation of my <a href='../leopard.htm'>first post on installing OsX 10.5 (Leopard) on this motherboard.</a>. Please have a look to the
information posted there on how to <a href='../leopard.htm#bios-setup'>setup the bios</a></p>

<p>A brief summary: everything works perfectly fine. Update from Leopard? check. 64 bits? check. Sleep, sound, network, graphics card? check ^ 4. I have been able also to <span class='mark'>upgrade to each release in the 10.6 version, from 10.6.1, to 10.6.8, normally with no problems or minus ones</span>. As of 10.6.5, the only hardware not working is the second ethernet card (Marvell 88E8001)</p>

<p>My main information was obtained at this <a href='http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=182227'>Generic Retail Install Guide</a>: it draws several options, from which I chosed the option Chameleon v2 RC1 USB Bootloader with Netkas PCEFIv10.1 patched boot [by The Guru FlashGX].</p>

<p>In any case, please note that, for this guide:<p><ul>
<li>even for a brand new install, it is assumed that a Os X installation (in principle, Leopard, but Tiger should be as valid) is available.</li>
<li>it requires two hard disks. One contains the Leopard installation, and another disk is used to please with the installation process, GUID partitioned.
</li></ul>

<p>BUT you do not need two hard disks. You can follow your own installation process, the 
<a href='http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=182227'>insanelymac</a> post gives quite a few alternatives on how to work it.</p>

<p>Neverthelles, even if you follow any alternative way, I think that reading how I succeeded on the installation can help you. Even just to know which are the specific KEXTS for this motherboard.</p>

<p>Let's go:</p>

<ul>
<li>I use a second hard drive, with GUID partitioning, with two partitions:<ul>
	<li>A big enough partition, called <span class='mark'>SNOW</span>, that will hold Snow Leopard, empty, formatted as Mac Os Extended (Journaled)</li>
	<li>A rather small partition (&lt;10 Gb), to copy the Snow Leopard DVD image. This partition is called <span class='mark'>SNOW_INSTALL</span></li>
</ul></li>

<li>If you intend to update your existing Leopard installation:<ul>
	<li>Copy the Leopard partition into <span class='mark'>SNOW</span>: that is, launch Disk Image, restore existing Leopard partition into <span class='mark'>SNOW</span></li>
	<li>After copying the partition, it is better to remove from the <span class='mark'>SNOW</span> partition any Hackintosh leftovers. This includes:<ul>
		<li>Remove the /Extra directory</li>
		<li>If possible, remove the KEXTS installed in /System/Library/Extensions. Even better, if possible, replace them with the original ones. 
		For the record, I did not remove these kexts, only removed the /Extra directory</li></ul></li>
	<li>You can be brave enough and perform an update on the existing Leopard partition directly. Up to you; if this is the case, <span class='mark'>SNOW</span> refers to your existing Leopard partition.</li></ul></li>
	
	
<li>Copy the DVD -Snow Leopard install- into <span class='mark'>SNOW_INSTALL</span> (again using Disk Image)</li>

<li>Time to setup a boot drive using a USB stick. This will be the bootloader for Snow Leopard. The boot loader can be quite small (around 128 Mb, if it is still possible to find such small drives); I link below to the original files, as there could be updates. Please note that downloading them requires in some cases free registration. If you find it more convenient, I have made these files also <a href='p5q-e-sl.zip'>available</a>.<ul>
	<li>Format the USB stick, using Disk Imager, as Max OS X Extended (Journaled)</li>
	<li>Run <a href='http://chameleon.osx86.hu/file_download/22/Chameleon-2.0-r431.pkg.zip'>chameleon (RC1 r431 package)</a> on it, no need to install any extras.</li>
	<li>Remove from the USB drive the 'boot' file on the root.</li>
	<li>The boot file provided in chameleon r431 package is not Snow Leopard compatible. Now, there are two options:<ul>
		<li>Copy the <a href='http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?act=attach&type=post&id=55126'>boot file</a> (free login required) from Netkas into the root</li>
		<li>Copy the boot file available from 
		<a href='http://chameleon.osx86.hu/file_download/37/Chameleon-2.0-RC3-r658-bin.tar.gz'>Chameleon 2.0 Rc3, r658 package</a>. This is my preferred solution, as the Netkas's boot seems to raise kernel panics when used on a MBR partition.</li></ul></li>
	<li>In directory Extra/Extensions, copy the following files (all require free login):<ul>
		<li><a href='http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?act=attach&type=post&id=54820'>fakesmc.kext</a></li>
		<li><a href='http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?act=attach&type=post&id=54821'>NullCPUPowerManagement.kext</a>. It disables the default Power Management from Apple. It is probably not needed (on the final installation is not required at all).</li>
		<li><a href='http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?act=attach&type=post&id=54822'>OpenHalRestart.kext</a></li></ul></li>
	<li>Edit in the Extra directory the file <span class='code'>com.apple.Boot.plist</span> and provide any sensitive values. Mine is available 
	<a href='../com.apple.Boot.plist'>here</a>, but if you are upgrading from Leopard you should definitely use your original contents (the same applies for 
	<span class='code'>smbios.plist)</span>.</li>
	<li>For your graphic card, you must ensure its support. For NVidia cards, the support is normally included directly in Os X; for this reason, I favour EFI strings over kext injections. For a Nvidia 9800GT, the required EFI string is included in this <a href='../com.apple.Boot.plist'>com.apple.Boot.plist</a> file; for other cards, please google how to handle it, or use the method described on the initial Leopard installation: run EFIStudio, select your card, when supported, and dump the EFI string to com.apple.Boot.plist.</li>
	</ul></li>
	
<li>Restart, boot from bootloader, and select the partition <span class='mark'>SNOW_INSTALL</span>.</li>
<li>When the installer starts, choose the <span class='mark'>SNOW</span> partition to install there Snow Leopard. If you had copied there your Leopard partition, the install will perform automatically an update.</li>
<li>Restart, boot from bootloader, and select now the parttition <span class='mark'>SNOW</span>. It should boot just fine, and it is not time to try the specifics of P5Q-E</li></ul>


<p>Whether you used the initial <a href='http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=182227'>guide</a>, or this one, you should have now a working Snow Leopard installation, which can boot in 32 or 64 bits, but with the following problems:</p>
<ul>
	<li>No ethernet</li>
	<li>No sound</li>
	<li>All HD icons are orange</li>
	<li>It still requires the boot USB stick. Even without this requirement, sleep will not yet work.</li>
</ul>
	
<p>Now, it is needed to install Chameleon on this partition, plus the same Extra directory already installed in the boot USB stick, and, of course, the boot file.</p>

<p>This is the final list of kexts that are required for Asus P5Q-E (all available <a href='p5q-e-sl.zip'>here</a>):</p>
	<ul><li><a href='http://cid-8b65993ef55cf014.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/OSx86/Snow%20Leopard/Drivers%20kext%20%5E5Sterowniki%5E6/==%20Other%20Peripheral%20Devices%20%5E5Inne%5E6%20==/IOAHCIBlockStorageInjector.kext.zip'>IOAHCIBlockStorageInjector.kext</a>: required to solve the orange icons (if you happen to dislike them), copy it into /Extra/Extensions</li>
	<li><a href='http://code.google.com/p/voodoohda/'>VoodooHDA</a>: install this package, it will override and backup any required kexts</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?act=attach&type=post&id=54820'>fakesmc.kext</a>, in /Extra/Extensions</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?act=attach&type=post&id=54822'>OpenHalRestart.kext</a>, in /Extra/Extensions</li>
	<li>NullCPUPowerManagement.kext: is NOT NEEDED, and, if present, will disable the normal Sleep.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Ethernet to work, only the first LAN port (Marvel 88E8056) will be enabled; the second port (Marvell 88E8001) can be managed with an additional kext (<a href='http://cid-8b65993ef55cf014.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/OSx86/Snow%20Leopard/Drivers%20kext%20%5E5Sterowniki%5E6/==%20%20LAN%20%5E0%20Wireless%20%5E5wi-fi%5E6%20==/skge.kext.zip'>skge.kext</a>), but, as of 10.6.5, this kext seems not to work). If you can live with just one Gigabyte LAN port, better avoid this driver; otherwise, it is needed to unload/reload the driver on sleep/wakeup cycles.</p>

<p>To enable the first LAN port (which, of the two available ports, is the one further away from the keyboard/mouse ports), the best approach is, on every OS update, to edit the file <span class='mark'>/System/Library/Extensions/IONetworkingFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleYukon2.kext/Contents/Info.plist</span>, find the key <span class='mark'>Yukon-88E8053</span>, and replacing it with the key name <span class='mark'>Yukon-88E8056</span>; in the values associated to this key, update also:<ul>
	<li>The key <span class='mark'>IOPCIPrimaryMatch</span>, which has value 0x436211ab should have instead value <span class='mark'>0x436411ab</span></li>
	<li>The key <span class='mark'>Model</span> should be also edited to have value <span class='mark'>Yukon Gigabit Adapter 88E8056 Singleport Copper SA</span>
</ul></p>

<p>After all is done, my final setup includes the Snow Leopard installation, in a GUID partition. I boot it (using still the boot loader), and then I restore it into the final MBR partition -in a hard disk with Kubuntu and Vista 64 bits-, reinstalling again Chameleon (plus specific boot file and KEXT files). Done!</p>

<h2><a name='updates'>Software Updates</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>10.6.1: Performed easily using the Software Update, no problems after restarting</li>
<li>10.6.2: Performed easily using the Software Update, no problems after restarting</li>
<li>10.6.3: Performed easily using the Software Update, no problems after restarting</li>
<li>10.6.4: Performed easily using the Software Update, no problems after restarting</li>
<li>10.6.5: Performed easily using the Software Update. After restarting, I lost any networking functionality. To solve it, I directly edited the file <span class='mark'>/System/Library/Extensions/IONetworkingFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleYukon2.kext/Contents/Info.plist</span>, making the changes described above. I also updated on this release the VoodooHDA driver, replaced with version 2.7.2, which removed all errors in my log files, and enabled on the way the usage of microphone. Fantastic.</li>
<li>10.6.6: Performed easily using the Software Update, no problems after restarting</li>
<li>10.6.7: Using the Software Update, found a problem after restarting: sound works (headphones), but the rear line ouput doesn't. This is
strange, as I am using the VoodooHDA driver, not the basic kext from Apple. After some fizzling, the problem lies on the autosensing jacks, as the output seems directed to the last sensed one. I have connected several, for subwoofer and side speakers, and everything works if the
green jack (line out) is disconnected and then reconnected: not the best solution, as it must be done after any reboot or sleep cycle.
Alternatively, disconnecting all jacks but the green one solves also the problem. A real, solid solution is going to require working on the DSDT or the info.plist, once I get the dump of the audio codec.
</li>
<li>10.6.8: Performed easily using the Software Update, no problems after restarting</li>
</ul>
