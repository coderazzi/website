<p class='timestamp'>22th May 2009</p>  <h1>Python decorators and optional arguments</h1>

<p>Python decorators are available since 
<a href='http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/'>version 2.4</a>.
Version 2.6 includes class decorators, 
but the following discussion refers exclusively to function decorators.</p>

<p>Function decorators are implemented as functions that take -eventually- 
another function as parameter, the 
function it is decorating-. This is not the only implementation alternative, as
decorators can be also implemented as classes, but for the purpose of this document,
the function implementation assumption is generic enough. For detailed information on decorators,
I would refer to its <a href='http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/'>PEP</a>, 
to the <a href='http://pypi.python.org/pypi/decorator/'>decorator.py</a> package, or to
this tutorial at 
<a href='http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-cpdecor.html?S_TACT=105AGX03&S_CMP=EDU'>developersworks</a>
</p>

<p>In short, the syntax:
<pre>@decorate
def f(....)</pre></p>

<p>is quite equivalent to do: 
<pre>f = decorate(f)</pre></p>
<p>That is, the decorator takes <span class="mark">f</span> as parameter, 
and the return value overrides the initial <span class="mark">f</span> definition.</p>

<p>Decorators can have arguments, like in:</p>

<pre>@decorate(message)
def f(....)</pre>

<p>In this case, the decoration is not carried out by 
<span class="mark">decorate</span> function, but by its return value. 
That is, this
example is quite equivalent to do:</p>
<pre>f = decorate(message)(f)</pre>

<p>Just in case, this is:</p>
<pre>temp = decorate(message)
f = temp(f)</pre>
   
<p>The distinction is important when the decorator's arguments are optional.</p>
<p>To see why, I will use a simple example, a unit tests package, that requires 
decorating the functions to test with a 
decorator <span class="mark">@test</span>, like in:</p>

<pre>@test
def functionToTest(...):
  pass</pre>
  
<p>Its implementation could be rather simple, just adding an attribute to the function to decorate:</p>

<pre>def test(f):
   f.test = True
   return f</pre>
  
<p>And the testing framework would then test all the functions with the given attribute. As the 
framework evolves, functionality is added to test categories, so that only the functions in 
the specified category are tested. With this purpose, the previous decorator is extended, accepting
now a parameter <span class="mark">category</span>; note that its implementation gets a bit 
more complicated, as the real decorator is now the returned value:</p>

<pre>def test(category):
   def real_decorator(f):
      f.test = True
      f.test_category = category
      return f
   return real_decorator</pre>
   
<p>This nesting is required, as we will use the decoration like in:</p>

<pre>@test('database')
  def f(....)</pre>

<p>equivalent to:</p> <pre>test('database')(f)</pre>

<p>But updating the decorator as shown above would break all the existing codebase, as  
it requires now a mandatory argument. A basic solution would be providing a 
default value:</p>

<pre>def test(category=None):
   def real_decorator(f):
      f.test = True
      f.test_category = category
      return f
   return real_decorator</pre>
   
<p>Unfortunately, this won't work. 
The codebase will still contain many functions decorated without arguments.
In those cases, we hare invoking the decorator with one parameter, but that 
passed parameter, that should be the category is, in fact, the function to decorate. 
For this to work, the decoration should be:</p>

<pre>f = test()(f)</pre>
   
<p>So the <span class="mark">correct</span> way to use the decorator becomes now:</p>

<pre>@test()
def functionToTest():
  print 'tested'</pre>

<p>Just to start, this is not elegant. A decorator without arguments is expected to be called without
those brackets.</p>

<p>And, to continue, there exists no complete solution, or better said, not completely generic solution.
Fortunately, there is a solution for <span class="mark">most</span> of the cases; 
the problem is that the decorator's function must be able to handle two different situations:
<ul>
<li>Called with arguments that represent the expected arguments. And return then something that will
be called again with the function to decorate.</li>
<li>Called with a single argument: the function to decorate.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The only possibility is to check:
<ul>
<li>That there is only one single argument, and is the first of the defined arguments.</li>
<li>And that its type is a function.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In this case, it is possible to assume that the decorator is being used without brackets. 
And this solution is generic as far as the decorator doesn't expect as first optional 
argument a function.</p>

<p>The previous example could be implemented now as:</p>

<pre>def test(category=None):
   def real_decorator(f):
      f.test = True
      f.test_category = category
      return f
   if type(category) == type(real_decorator):
      return real_decorator(category)
   return real_decorator</pre>
   
<p>Obviously, if the category could be a function, this wouldn't work. If the decorator expects more
than one optional argument, better place those with function values -if any- on the second or later 
positions.</p>

<p>Just a final note on the previous code: it verifies if the type of the argument is a function, but
not if it is a method in a class. When a method's class is decorated, the decoration mechanism is
triggered before it is bounded to the class, so it would be useless to write the more extended check:</p>

<pre>if type(category)==types.FunctionType or type(category)==types.MethodType :
	...</pre>
