<h2><a name='Description'>Description</a></h2>
<p><span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span> is a lightweight library to map Xml documents to C# classes, whose
  main purpose is to simplify the handling of simple Xml files; its objective
  is not the serialization of objects in Xml (this functionality is built in
  .Net).</p>

<p>The mention of simple Xml files applies to two restrictions:
<ul>
  <li>Size: the file is mapped to C# classes, all the required information 
    maps to structures in memory.</li>
  <li>Definition: currently, namespaces are not supported.</li>
</ul></p>  

<p>With <span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span>, the programmer must create a hierarchy of classes that represents
directly the Xml instances; my main objective is to facilitate the handling of
configuration files, although it can obviously read any Xml files -and write them-.</p>

<h2><a name='LicenseAndDownload'>License and download</a></h2>
<p><span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span> is delivered as it, without
any responsabilities on the author. It is open source, it can be used or
modified without any limitations.</p>

<p>The library is only available in source format. 
<ul>
	<li>Version 1.10. (05/05/08). This version adds minimum support to
        be used by <a href='http://www.coderazzi.net/csharp/xmlobjectsdocgui'>XmlObjectsDocGui</a>, by exposing some previously private methods. The functionality is
        the same as in version 1.00.

</p>


<h2><a name='Usefulness'>Usefulness of xmlobjects</a></h2>

<p>In many cases -even most cases-, the support provided by <span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span> is redundant,
as quite an equivalent functionality is directly build in the .Net framework.</p>

<p>The Xml Serialization support in the framework -defined in the namespace
<span class='code'>System.Xml.Serialization</span>- already provides a mapping between
C# classes and Xml instances. And the <span class='code'>System.Configuration</span>
namespace provides the required support for handling configuration files in client
applications; explanations of these mechanisms can be found in the following URLs:
<ul><li><a href='http://www.pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig/XmlSerializerSectionHandler.html'>Xml Serialization Section Handler</a></li>
<li><a href='http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/20060622.asp'>Creating an Object Configuration Section in .Net 2.0</a></li></ul></p>

<p>I wrote <span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span> beacuse I needed a specific feature, not covered directly in the
Xml serialization .Net support: knowing the specific order on which subelements are
defined. I know that such functionality can be indirectly covered, adding extra information
in the Xml file, or providing my custom reader/writer for the specific Xml class; however,
modifying the schema is not always an option, and customizing the reader/writer already
requires some effort. Obviously, such effort would always be lesser than writing the
<span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span> library, but having my own implementation could facilitate introducing further
requirements.</p>

<p>Specific features supported in <span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span>:
<ul>
 <li>It can provide the order on which elements are defined.</li>
 <li>It supports building a complete hierarchy of objects to represent the Xml instance, with parent and
 child relationships.</li>
 <li>It supports <span class='code'>List&lt;T&gt;</span> fields; arrays of elements can be associated to basic arrays or generic lists.</li>
 <li>For primitive types, mapped to Xml attributes, the library can provided extended knowledge on
 whether those attributes have been specified or not in the Xml file.</li>
 <li>C# classes can define methods that are called when the reading or writing is performed.</li>
 <li>It supports generic elements, arrays to store subelements not directly mapped to class attributes.</li>
 <li>It supports easy configuration of the default behaviour.</li>
 <li>Source is fully available, together with a complete set of unit tests.</li>
</ul> 
</p>


<h2><a name='Interface'>Interface</a></h2>
<p>The main objective of <span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span> is the reading of simple files; the programmer defines one or more classes that map the Xml schema, and triggers the creation of C# instances by reading the Xml file.
For example, a class with the following fields:
<pre>
	public class Example {
		public string name;
		public Subname subs;
	}
	
	public class Subname {...}
</pre>	
	has the Xml representation as:
<pre>
	&lt;Example name='...'&gt;
		&lt;Subname ... &gt; ... &lt;/Subname&gt;
		...
	&lt;/Example&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>As with the <span class='code'>System.Xml.Serialization</span> namespace, <span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span> rely on
custom attributes to modify the default behaviour.</p>

<p>Any class can be mapped to a Xml type. By default, any public field is mapped to an attribute or a nested element of the Xml type. Note that this differs from the <span class='code'>System.Xml.Serialization</span> namespace, where public fields or properties can be mapped.</p>

<p>If the field's type is a primitive, an enumeration or a string, the mapping defaults to Xml attributes; in the rest of the cases, they map to Xml nested elements, as shown on the example above.
This behaviour can be customized, for all the fields or for each individual field. The exception is the array fields, mapped always as attributes.</p>

<p>The library knows how to map automatically arrays, and has built-in support
for <span class='code'>List&lt;T&gt;</span> elements, where T is not a <span class='code'>List&lt;T&gt;</span> itself. This means that having an ArrayList field, for example, will not have the expected result (replacing an array of objects)</p>
	
<h3><a name='type'>Type attributes</a></h3>
<p>A type can be decorated with the XmlType attribute, which allows the following modifiers:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class='options'>AttributeFields</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>By default is true, meaning that basic public fields 
	  associated to non-array types are mapped to Xml attributes.
		Setting it to true maps those fields to nested elements.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span class='options'>ChildsFields</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>If specified, the given field will contain 
	  the references to all the child nodes, in the order found in the Xml file.
		This property is important when the order of the nested elements makes a 
		difference.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span class='options'>ExplicitFields</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>By default is false, meaning that all the public fields have
	  Xml associations (unless a specific field includes the attribute 
	  XmlNoField). If it is set to true, the mapping fields must include the attribute 
		XmlField.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span class='options'>GenericElementField</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>If specified, the given field will contain the
	  references to all the element not directly defined.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span class='options'>InnerTextField</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>If specified, the given field will receive the inner text 
	  for a given Xml definition (if any).
		For example: 
		<pre>&lt;Subname&gt;Dog&lt;/Subname&gt;</pre> 
		has <span class='code'>Dog</span> as inner text. 
		If a Xml type has a given inner text and the type does not define an inner 
		  field, it is checked if the type defines a static Parse(string) method.
			If it does not, a Xml reading error is raised. Otherwise, the Parse 
			method is invoked, but the type cannot then define any nested elements 
			or attributes.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span class='options'>ParentField</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>If specified, the given field (which must be public) will 
	  contain the reference to the parent node in the Xml file.
		This field will allow then full hierarchical navigation.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span class='options'>ProvidedFieldsSupport</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>boolean value, related to the support of 
	  <a href='#provided'>provided</a> attributes or elements.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span class='options'>TypeAttribute</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>This attribute relates to the support of
	  <a href='#polymorphism'>polymorphism</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span class='options'>XmlReadCompletedMethod</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>If specified, the given method (no parameters), is called
	  when the whole Xml has been parsed.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span class='options'>XmlWritePrepareMethod</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>If specified, the given method (no parameters), is called
	  when the Xml is to be written.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span class='options'>XmlWriteCompletedMethod</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>If specified, the given method (no parameters), is called
	  when the Xml writting is completed.</li>
	</ul>
</ul></p>
			
<p>The XmlType attribute is not inherited, affects only to the declaring class.
A subclass could define different settings for this attribute, but the
  redefined settings do not affect the parent classes.</p>
<p>For example, if the parent class defines the innerTextField, the subclass
    can define another innerTextField, and both fields will be set.</p>
<p>There is a limitation on the fields that can be specified in the type
    attribute: they can only refer to the declaring class. That is, a
    subclass cannot define its InnerTextField as a field defined above
    in its hierarchy.</p>

<h3><a name='field'>Field attributes</a></h3>
<p>The fields in a type can have two attributes: XmlNoField, meaning that the 
  field has no Xml representation, and XmlField, which has the opposite meaning.</p>

<p>XmlField allows the following modifiers:
<ul>
	<li><span class='options'>Name</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>specifies the name of the associated attribute/element. 
	  If not specified, the Xml name is the variable name (case is not important)</li>
	</ul>
	<li><span class='options'>AsElement</span>:
	<ul>
		<li>A boolean value, it defines, for non-array types, whether the mapping is to an 
	  attribute or to a nested element.</li>
	</ul>
</ul></p>	
	
<p>The mapping is always case unsensitive. This implies that it is an error to define a class with two fields differing only in case.</p>

<h2><a name='serialization'>Xml serialization</a></h2>
  
<p>The library allows as well to save an instance as Xml, using the same 
  specifications described for the loading. The objective of the library
  is to read / store Xml files, not to serialize the passed objects. In
  special, recursive definitions are not allowed.</p>
  
  
<h2><a name='polymorphism'>Polymorphism support</a></h2>
  
<p>The library supports polymorphism on the Xml elements. For example, in the
  following C# classes:
<pre>  
  class File { 
    public string name;
  }
  class Folder : File  {
    public File[] file;
  }
</pre>  
  when a Folder is stored, if any of the referenced files is itself a folder,
  it will be stored as a folder (with subfiles). On this example, the stored
  Xml could look like:
<pre>  
  &lt;File name='\'&gt;
    &lt;File name='.' /&gt;
    &lt;File name='..' /&gt;
  &lt;/File&gt;
</pre>  
  That is, even when a File object is being stored, information on the fields
    defined it its real type (Folder), are used in the output (in this case,
    all the File subelements).</p>
    
<p>In some cases, this can be all that is needed, specially if the library is
    only used to save Xml files. However, if the produced file is read again
    by <span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span>, using the same C# classes, there will be an error: a File
    is created with name '\', and then a subelement with name 'File' is
    required, but a File instance knows nothing about any 'File' field!</p>
    
<p>As mentioned above, <span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span> does not intend to do objects serialization,
    but supporting this scenario makes perfect sense when the same 
    polymorphism ideas are applied to the Xml definitions. In particular, this
    enables scenarios where the user or 3rd party libraries can extend 
    predefined Xml (configuration or not) files.</p>
    
<p>To enable this support, the Xml element can include an optional element
    describing its real type, like in the following <span class='mark'>uncomplete</span>
	example:     
<pre>
  &lt;File name='\' type='Folder'&gt;
    &lt;File name='.' /&gt;
    &lt;File name='..' /&gt;
  &lt;/File&gt;
</pre>  
  In this case, the  'type' attribute is used to specify the real type. It has
    no representation on the C# classes, there is no need to specify a field
    with that name (in fact, it would raise an error).</p>
    
<p>It is possible to specify the name of the type attribute in the 
    XmlTypeAttribute associated to a class, or in a general way for all the
    classes. The following restrictions apply:
<ul>	
    <li>The type must be the same type (or subclass) of the expected type.</li>
    <li>When storing the Xml objects, the type is only output if needed (if 
       the type is different from the expected type)</li>
</ul>	   
</p>
<p>The type attribute must include the full class type specification; and, if it is
defined outside the assembly of the original type, the assembly is required as well.
An example without assembly is:
<pre>
&lt;file name='aname' type='XmlObjectsTestUnits.TestB02TypeAssembly+NewFile&gt;
</pre>
And the following example shows the assembly information as well:
<pre>
&lt;file name='aname' type='XmlObjectsTestUnits.TestB02TypeAssembly+NewFile, 
NunitTests, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'/&gt;
</pre>
</p>  
  
    
<h2><a name='provided'>Provided support</a></h2>

<p>In some cases, it is needed to know when the Xml specifies one attribute or
  not; for example

<pre>  
  &lt;given times='0'/&gt;
</pre>
can be indistinguable from 
<pre>
&lt;given/&gt;
</pre>
when times is handled as an integer attribute.</p>
    
<p>If the class defines a boolean type named 'timesAttributeProvided', <span class='mark'>after</span>
the type 'times' is specified, and has no associated [XmlField] attribute, it is handled as a support field, that will contain true or false depending on whether the attribute is specified or not.</p>
   
<p>If the main type is an element, not an attribute, but is not an array, it can use the same functionality, but the support field must be named like in 'timesElementProvided'</p>
   
<h2><a name='docgeneration'>Generating documentation</a></h2>
    
<p>From version 1.10, it is possible to generate automatically HTML documentation from the XML schema.</p>

<p>The generation is done by an external program, this functionality is not implemented directly 
in <span class='mark'>xmlobjects</span>, as different generation models could be used.</p>

<p>The project <a href='http://www.coderazzi.net/csharp/xmlobjectsdocgui'>XmlObjectsDocGui</a> performs this task.</p>
