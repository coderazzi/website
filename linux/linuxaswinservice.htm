<h1>Ubuntu server as a Windows service</h1>

<img src='ubuntuonwindows.jpg' class='right'/>

<p>To host the production environment of a Rails application I had recently
	developed, I was offered a standalone server, running Windows 7 Professional,
	on a static IP address. Rails + Windows is an unholy union, and to 
	isolate as well the Windows machine from compromises on the web application, I 
	decided to run Ubuntu Server on a VirtualBox instance. The final purpose was 
	to run Ubuntu without any GUI, reachable exclusively via SSH, and handled 
	as a Windows service; in this way, the server would be automatically 
	started or shutdown with the Windows machine.<p>

<p>And this is the tale on how I accomplished it. Obviously this story changes 
	with the time, eventually becoming obsolete. It relates to the end of 2011, 
	when the most recent Ubuntu Server distribution is 11.10, and the 
	most updated VirtualBox release is 4.1.x. Furthermore, the host is running 
	Windows 7 Professional (64 bits), using a i5 2500K CPU and 8 gigabytes of 
	memory.</p>
	
<ol>
	<li>Download and install <a href='https://www.virtualbox.org/'>virtualbox</a></li>
	
	<li>Download the Ubuntu server distribution. To speed up the download, the 
		best is to download the alternate torrent distribution 
		(currently: ubuntu-11.10-server-amd64.iso.torrent), ensuring that the 
		md5 hash <a href='https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes'>matches</a>.</li>
		
	<li>Start virtualbox, and create a virtual machine (I named mine 
		<span class='mark'>Wimel</span>) with type Ubuntu (64 bits), using
		1.5 Gigas and a dynamically allocated VDI hard disk of 50 Gigas; these
		are arbitrary sizes, the memory depends obviously on the final usage
		requirements, and 1 Gigabyte should be enough for most purposes; 
		likewise, 50 Gigas is a lot of space. Enough to say that once the
		server and all my required applications were installed, only 2 
		gigabytes were used. But being dynamically allocated, it means that
		there is space (a lot!) to grow, without immediately using it.</li>
		
	<li>After creation, go to the instance configuration in virtualbox. 
		On storage, provide the path to the downloaded Ubuntu iso, and, on
		system, allocate 2 processors. Once again, this allocation reflects
		my own needs, where I gave as much importance to the linux machine as
		to the Windows host.</li>
		
	<li>Start now the virtual machine. Select language and keyboard, provide 
		a hostname and use the entire disk (no LVM). For a Rails server,
		I only installed the OpenSSH server (LAMP, specially, not required). 
		Afterwards, install the GRUB loader to the master boot record, and 
		complete the installation.</li>
		
	<li>After the required reboot, perform the usual maintenance on a Debian
		distribution:
			
<pre>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade</pre>
			
		</ul></li>
		
	<li>The objective is to have this machine reachable from the Internet.
		How this is accomplished depends obviously on your network configuration; 
		my situation favored allocating an static IP address, and this 
		<a href='http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/change-ubuntu-server-from-dhcp-to-a-static-ip-address/'>link</a>
		provides the complete solution:
			
<pre>sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces</pre>

		And replace in this file
		
<pre>auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp</pre>

		with

<pre>iface eth0 inet static
	address 192.168.0.105
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	network 192.168.0.0
	broadcast 192.168.0.255
	gateway 192.168.0.1</pre>
	
		(Please change the address/network as required for your
		specific needs). To update now the DNS host:</li>
				
<pre>sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf</pre>

		which should contain one single line: your own DNS server:

<pre>nameserver 192.168.0.1</pre>
				
		Finally, shutdown the machine
		
<pre>sudo shutdown -h now</pre>

	</li>
			
	<li>This is still not the complete network solution; it is needed to go
		now to the virtualbox configuration of this machine and select
		<span class='mark'>Bridge adapter</span> instead of the default NAT. 
		After this, restart once again the virtual machine.</li>
		
	<li>The Ubuntu virtual machine is now reachable via SSH. Obviously, 
		 it is needed some network address translation magic to access this machine from 
		the internet. In special, with the static IP address (192.168.0.105 in this case)
		it is needed to setup NAPT (Network Address and Port Translation) to access the port 
		22 on 192.168.0.105 via an external port (like 5022). This depend on your router; I have an 
		old Alcatel router that allows this setup, while a much newer router, 
		a Netgear WNDR3700 does not fully allow it (I can perform the
		NAPT translation only from the same or lower port, not from a 
		higher port).</li>
		
	<li>Once this process is completed, the machine can be accessed using 
		SSH, using: <pre>ssh -p port user@host</pre>
		where port is the NATP port and host is the host allocated to the
		router. Likewise, it is possible to access it using SFTP with:
		<pre>sftp -oPort=port user@host</pre></li>
			
			
	<li>Now it comes the second part of the whole setup: the virtual machine 
		has to be setup to start automatically on windows startup.
		Shutdown first the virtual machine, and get ready to install the 
		great <a href='http://vboxvmservice.sourceforge.net/'>VBoxVmService</a>,
		currently on version 3.0. Download it and install it on 
		<pre>c:\vms</pre>
		Then, follow the instructions on <pre>c:\vms\doc\howto.txt</pre>
		which basically, implies a configuration file
		<pre>c:\vms\vboxvmservice.ini</pre> 
		looking like:
<pre>[Settings]
ServiceName=VBoxVmService
RunAsUser=.\xxUSERxx
UserPassword=xxPASSWORDxx
VBOX_USER_HOME=C:\Users\xxUSERxx\.VirtualBox
RunWebService=no
PauseShutdown=5000

[Vm0]
VmName=Wimel
ShutdownMethod=savestate
AutoStart=yes</pre>
		This setups one single virtual machine called Wimel, but multiple
		machines could be setup automatically. Note that the windows user
		and password must be hardcoded in the file, so pay attention to the
		access rights.</li>
		
	<li>Once the configuration file is on place, install the service with:
		<pre>VmServiceControl.exe -i</pre>
		Then, reboot the system</li>
		
	<li>It should work perfectly.... although it didn't work for me none of 
		the times I tried it. I had to do, in addition:<ul>
		<li>Open Panel Control / System / Administrative tools / Services</li>
		<li>Locate vboxvmservice. Open it, and then:<ul>
		     <li>In init session, enter again the user / password</li>
		     <li>Set it up to start as automatic (no delayed).</li></ul></li></ul></li>
		
</ol>

<p>And that's the lengthy process to have it working. And having it working great.</p>
