 <h1>Installing Meego for dual boot[Samsung NC10]</h1>

 <p class="note">This entry applies specifically to Meego 1.0; there is already an updated version (1.1)
	since the 28th October 2010.</p>
<p>
	This is a very small guide describing the steps I took to install Meego on my netbook
	(Samsung NC10), preparing it to dual boot with the default XP installation.
</p>

<p>
	This netbook includes a 160 Gb hard disk with 3 partitions: one hidden, the partition with
	XP and an additional with 85 Gb; I installed Meego on part of this last partition, which contained only
	some data I was able to get rid of. For the record, I first did a complete system backup,
	using Acronis True Image. I was then able to proceed with the installation.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		I downloaded the 
		<a href='http://download5.meego.com/'>Chrome version</a> and created a USB stick, following the
		instructions in 
		<a href='http://meego.com/devices/netbook/installing-meego-your-netbook'>the Meego web site</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		I restarted then the netbook, booting from the USB stick [my BIOS was configured already to start
		from USB, if present].
	</li>
	<li>
		On the initial menu, I opted directly for the <span class='mark'>only install</span> option.
	</li>
	<li>
		Then it comes the language choice, and immediately the partition selection: select here
		<span class='mark'>create custom layout</span>. The existing layout is:
		<ul>
			<li>sda1, 6 Gb: this is the recovery partition</li>
			<li>sda2, 62 Gb: the XP partition</li>
			<li>sda3, 85 Gb: the additional partition, where Meego will be installed.</li>
		</ul>
		It is needed to remove this last partition, to create a few new partitions. 
		I decided to let a partition of about 40 Gb that could still be used in Windows.
		So, remove first the sda3 partition, and the create:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Swap partition:
				<ul>
					<li>mount point: [None]</li>
					<li>file system: swap</li>
					<li>size: 4096 Mb</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Boot partition:
				<ul>
					<li>mount point: /boot</li>
					<li>file system: ext3</li>
					<li>size: 200 Mb</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Root partition:
				<ul>
					<li>mount point: /</li>
					<li>file system: brtfs</li>
					<li>size: 40600 Mb</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Remaining size, allocated for a Windows partition:
				<ul>
					<li>mount point: [None]</li>
					<li>file system: vfat</li>
					<li>size: fill to maximum allowable size</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		The order on which the partitions are created is not particularly important, as the 
		installation will not create them in the given order. What I was unable to do was to
		rethink some steps: creating a partition and then removing it to be created with
		different parameters would usually require rebooting the system to start again. This
		is not that bad -no changes are commited on the hard disk until later-
	</li>
	<li>
		The next input requests whether to use a password for the boot loader, 
		and it is now possible to edit the entries in the boot loader: label /dev/sda2 as 'Windows XP'.
		For some reason (or bug), I was only able to add /dev/sda1, which was rather useless, so
		I had to edit the boot configuration later (see below).
	</li>
	<li>
		Reboot, removing first the USB drive. It is now needed to add some settings:
		-Keyboard, location, date, send or not crashes information, and user / password.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Easy, and fast, these steps build a dual boot Meego / XP configuration. In the Samsung NC-10,
	all the hardware works fine; not all hotkeys are programmed, in special the brightness keys
	do not work, although the volume / mute and a few others are correctly setup. To correct the
	brightness hotkeys, please follow <a href='brightness.html'>these instructions</a>. The Wifi
	hardware also works fine, requiring obviously configuring the connection.
</p>

<p>
	The system is now able to dual boot, although it is configured in such a way that no initial
	menu is displayed, and it really looks as only Meego is available. The boot loader in Meego is
	not Grub -or Grub2-, but extlinux, a syslinux variant, and is configured using the file
	<span class='mark'>/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf</span>. To have a timeout of 2 seconds, and the
	OS menu shown, the following entries are required (the second, in fact, requires commenting it out):
	<pre>timeout 20
#menu hidden</pre>
	In my installation, Windows XP was associated to /dev/sda1 instead of /dev/sda2, so a further change
	was needed on this file: under the option menu for Windows XP, which in my case looked like:
	<pre>label Other
	menu label Windows XP
	kernel chain.c32
	append boot 1</pre>
	the last line had to change into
	<pre>append boot 2</pre>
</p>
