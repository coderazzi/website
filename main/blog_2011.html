	<p> <img src="images/wubuntu.jpg" alt="table filter icon" class="blog">
	I had recently to setup a server to host a Rails application. What initially should
	had been a simple task, developed some complications when the whole setup was included,
	considering backups, etc. The initial complication was the operative system, as the
	server was running Windows 7 Professional, and Rails presents some allergy symptoms on
	that environment.</p>
	<p>So I first installed Ubuntu Server as a virtual machine, and then associated it to
		a windows service, to enable its automatically start / shutdown. This is, in fact,
		a very useful setup, so I decided to describe it in detail here:

	 <p> <img src="images/tablefilter.png" alt="table filter icon" class="blog">
	 New version, <a href='tablefilter/index.html'>4.2.0</a>, for the library.</p>
	 <p>Release covering a few  
	 <a href='http://code.google.com/p/tablefilter-swing/issues/list?can=1&q=&colspec=ID+Type+Status+Priority+Milestone+Owner+Summary&cells=tiles'>issues</a>, including one new proposed feature: the ability to disable the user's interaction with

	<p class="blog-entry"><span class="blog-entry-date">11th November 2011</span>Domains</p> 

	<p> <img src='images/domains.jpg' class='blog'/>
		I first applied for a domain name in 2006; in that moment I requested a personal one, using Yahoo as
		registrar, and another one for a company in Spain. 
	</p>
	
	<p>Yahoo's web interface was very easy to use, but
		after two years they increased the registry price like 300%, to 35$ per year. 
		I dumped them immediately, but they really took their time to transfer my domain, 
		which was unavailable for about 2 weeks. A company
		could not (should not) afford this downtime, so my respect for Yahoo decreased many levels.
	</p>
	
	<p>I transferred my domain to <a href='http://www.namecheap.com/'>Namecheap</a>. 
		I have no idea of marketing, but the name of the registrar seems
		definitely wrong to me. And there is nothing cheap with the service, as I have only praise for them. 
		I regularly read complains on bad support, and I have never needed contacting them, so I cannot 
		comment on that, but their website is fast, and provides all the means to perform all required 
		operations with the domain, and the knowledge database has been always enough to
		answer my doubts. I have been able to setup dynamic DNS, forwarding of emails, etc, plus, of course, 
		the more usual basic domain maintenance. 
	</p>
	
	<p>	When last week I wanted to get a new domain, I checked other sites, and 
		<a href='http://www.godaddy.com/'>GoDaddy</a> would have saved  me a few bucks over a 5 years period, 
		but I preferred to stick to Namecheap. It is definitely better to have a single site to control your 
		domains as different registrars provide very different mechanisms to provide the same functionality. 
		In retrospect, perhaps I should have tried GoDaddy to check their support and service, but well, too late now.
	</p>
	
	<p>5 months ago, my brother in law dumped unceremoniously his webmaster, asking me to take over. 
		His webmaster retained the website -which went down, of course-, and didn't transfer the domain's name. 
		Whether this is legal or moral helps little to have a website up again in short time, so we
		decided on acquiring a new domain name. My brother in law gave me several names that he wanted to 
		register, and told me the registrar (<a href='http://www.arsys.es/'>Arsys.es</a>) to use, 
		one which had been recommended to him. I checked their prices, and at 25 euros/year I couldn't imagine why someone 
		with good intentions would recommend them.
	</p>

	<p>Seriously: a registrar work is rather limited:<ul>
		<li>Ensure proper registration.</li>
		<li>Provide as many payment options as possible.</li>
		<li>Ensure that all functionality is reachable via their website, and this website to be fast.</li>
		<li>In addition, bonuses included provide dynamic DNS, email handling, etc.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>Namecheap provides this functionality -with all the bonuses- for 8 euros per year. I could expect to 
		have sites offering better prices, and perhaps, less funcionality, so I wonder at these sites expecting 
		25 euros (or 35 euros, in the case of Yahoo). This is not at all advertising to use Namecheap, I just wonder 
		why there are users using other registrars offering (much) less bang for the buck.
		And even recommend them on good will.

	<p class="blog-entry"><span class="blog-entry-date">26th May 2011</span>Crunchbang Linux</p> 
	
	<p> <img src='images/crunchbang.png' class='blog'/>
	
		I have been running for a while <a href='http://crunchbanglinux.org/'>Crunchbang</a> 
		as my desktop Linux distribution, and
		despite some rough edges, I am quite happy with my choice.</p>

	<p>I decided today to use it as well on a new system, and my first problem happened
	directly on the installation, with complains that the cdrom media could not be
	loaded [effectively, I was trying to install using a usb stick, the target system
	hadn't even a cdrom!]. I pressed Alt-F2 to activate a terminal and solved it entered
	(being /dev/sdb my usb stick):</p>

	<pre>mount -t vfat /dev/sdb /cdrom</pre>

	<p>This was enough to continue the installation process (pressing
		Alt-F1 to get back from the terminal)</p>

	<p>The installation process had some more rough edges: when a prompt appeared to
	request the timezone, only America options were available (after my mistake, 
	when I introduced American as my locale, trying to get the proper configuration 
	for my US keyboard); to get other options is needed to change the locale, 
	but then there is no option to get back to the timezone! 
	Alas, the solution is easy, enough to reconfigure the timezone:</p>

	<pre>sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata</pre>

	<p>Then, some options to configure Crunchbang:</p>

	<ul><span class='mark'>Enable autologin</span>:System -> GDM login setup -> Security -> Enable automatic login</ul>
	<ul><span class='mark'>Enable suspend</span>:Settings -> Power manager ->General: When power button is pressed -> Suspend</ul>
	<ul><span class='mark'>Do not request password after suspend</span>:Settings -> Power manager ->Extended: Do not lock screen</ul>
	<ul><span class='mark'>Disable screensaver</span>:Settings -> Screensaver -> disable it (and do not lock screen)</ul>
	<ul><span class='mark'>Put monitor to sleep after some time</span>: Settings -> Power manager ->On AC-> Monitor -> set times</ul>

	<p class="blog-entry"><span class="blog-entry-date">24th March 2011</span>Hackintosh, 10.6.7 on P5Q-E</p> 

	<p> <img src='images/hackintosh.png' alt='hackintosh icon' class='blog'/>My hackintosh using mobo
	<a href='osx/p5q-e/snowleopard/index.html'>P5Q-E</a> 
	has gone through most 10.6.x updates without problems, at least compared to the usual ones
	on my P5N7A-VM hackintosh. Alas, 10.6.7 had to be different.</p>
	
	<p>Using the Software Update, found a problem after restarting: sound works (headphones), 
	 but the rear line ouput doesn't. This is strange, as I am using the VoodooHDA driver, 
	 not the basic kext from Apple. After some fizzling, the problem lies on the autosensing 
	 jacks, as the output seems directed to the last sensed one. I have connected several, 
	 for subwoofer and side speakers, and everything works if the green jack (line out) is 
	 disconnected and then reconnected: not the best solution, as it must be done after any 
	 reboot or sleep cycle. Alternatively, disconnecting all jacks but the green one solves 
	 also the problem.</p>
	 
	<p>A real, solid solution is going to require working on the DSDT or the info.plist, once I 
	get the dump of the audio codec.</p>

	<p> <img src='images/14vs30.png' alt='monitor size comparison' class='blog_fix'/>Spoiled geek: 
	geek who orders a 30" monitors and, on first impression, thinks: is not THAT big.<br>

	The associated image shows the size comparison between a 30" monitor and the first
	TV I used to program (a 14", where I spent many many hours and I am ashamed
	not to do not remember even the brand, although I would bet on Sanyo).<br>
	
	The 30" monitor is about 4 times bigger, in viewable size. The resolution
	difference ist just massive; I used a ZX Spectrum on the 14" TV, with a 
	resolution of 256x192, which relates quite well to the 2560x1600 resolution
	of the new monitor: 10 times more pixels horizontally, above 8 times more
	vertically.<br>
	
	Which means that a pixel on the 30" monitor is about 25% smaller than on the
	14" TV.<br>
	
	But this is nothing compared to using the very same ZX Spectrum on any of
	the current 56" LCDs. Something must look really wrong when a pixel measures
	almost 1/2 cm on a side. And 56" is not at all among the biggest sizes, so . . .<br>
	
	Yes, 30" is not that big.</p>

	<p class="blog-entry"><span class="blog-entry-date">16th March 2011</span>Does age matters?</p> 

	 <p> <img src="images/age.jpg" alt="age matters icon" class="blog">
	 Investigoogling, for whatever reasons, I find often articles exhibiting no date. 
	 In many cases, such omission is non important, let's say, for example, a review of the Ipad. 
	 It is bound to be an article from 2010, right? Anyway, it is meaningful if the review is done 
	 just after the product was delivered, or it is a mature review, highligthing usability issues 
	 after a long contact period.</p>

	<p>So I cannot stop wondering the reasons why some article or blog would omit the 
	dictation / publishing date, specially if such omission seems deliberated. 
	For example, in PcMagazine, I find always entertaining, and some times interesting, 
	the articles from <a href='http://www.pcmag.com/author_bio/0,1908,a%253D123,00.asp'>John C. Dvorak</a>; 
	they seems to be always properly dated. But then, the very same magazine provides 
	entries without any visible date. For example, this recent page called 
	<a href='http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/261776/albert-einstein-seven-things-you-didn-t-know'>
	Albert Einstein: Seven Things You Didn't Know</a>: it has no date at all; so the line 
	<span class='mark'>'Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany on this date in 1879'</span> 
	has definitely less information than expected. <note>Update: date included on original article</note>. 
	Perhaps the author didn't really know 
	on which date Einstein was born, or was unaware on the date he was writing the story, 
	but seems, anyway, a deliberate mistake.</p>

	<p>This problem is specially acute for those cases where the target is to find a solution 
	to a technical problem. Let's say, Linux is misbehaving and a Grub entry is missing: 
	because of rapid evolution, a solution from 2008 will be, probably, totally useless 
	by now, but, if the googled entry has no date, the googleer can try, in vane, the 
	obsolete solution. Certainly, Google allows limiting the search to specific periods in time 
	(see <a href='http://www.gtricks.com/google-tricks/how-to-criteria-limit-search-past-date-year/'>this gtrick</a>), 
	and such search is in fact more trusty than relying on the article's date, but 
	it lets me wondering all the same on the reasons to let a post undated.

	 After a long time implementing the changes for version 4.0, there were lots of minor details that could enhance the
	 usability of the library. <a href='tablefilter/index.html'>Version 4.1</a> goes in this direction, implementing 
	 instant filtering, full autocompletion, feedback to

	<p class="blog-entry"><span class="blog-entry-date">13th January 2011</span>WebM and my two cents</p> 

	<p> <img src='images/chrome.png' class='blog'/>I read with some dismay the news of Chrome ditching H.264, 
	although I could not point the reasons causing the discomfort. Finally, I have identified them: 
	I disliked the aggresiveness of the movement, but, is it really aggressive?</p>

	<p> Chrome lags behind Firefox and Explorer on maket share; removing H.264 support from Chrome should 
	have much less impact than the movement of Apple removing flash support. If any user wants to see 
	H.264 video can default to other browsers, which is definitely not an option on iOs devices.</p>

	<p> However, it also states a message: Google against H.264. Some people has called Google hypocrite, 
	by not going the full route -ditching also Flash, removing H.264 support from youtube, and Android, 
	removing also support for other close technologies like AAC audio-, but that is what will most 
	likely happen in the future. In this moment, H.264 (or WebM) are not full replacements for flash, 
	so flash is still needed; youtube? removing H.264 support today is losing, immediately, many visitors. 
	But, more important: it is aggressive, it is evil. It is enough to state the message: 
	H.264 will likely be not supported in the future, check the alternatives. </p>

	<p> And, it is needed this movement? In fact, yes; H.264 is still a nascent way to provide videos on the 
	Web via de HTML5 video tag-specification not yet even approuved-. 
	Once, a similar problem happened with GIF images, which were not royalty free, so the PNG format was 
	developed. In that moment, dropping support for GIF images would have been a too late move, rendering 
	unaccesible many sites. If GIF and PNG format had been made available at the same time, dropping GIF
	support would have been the obvious move. So the obvious move now seems to be dropping the H.264 encoding.</p>

	<p> Aggresive? In fact, cautious.</p>

	doesn't wanna facilitate hackintoshing, to better sell applications through the new App Store. Nah!...</p>
