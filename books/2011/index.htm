<p>I had read Trevanian some eons ago, so finding this novel at the local bookstore picked
	up my interest. This book is indeed the continuation -or based on- of Trevanian's Shibumi,
	which had a mix of oriental fighting arts, mystic, sex content and sophistication 
	that I found at some moment	appealing.</p>

<p>In Satori the same line remains, the prose is good, the plot is James Bond-believable, and
	the description of places and situations really well developed. But, somehow, it has not the
	soul of the original novel; and the characters, definitely, look cheap stereotypes, placed there
	to fill a story, making the whole plot even more forgettable. 
	Or perhaps, on the lapsed eons, I have grown to expect something
	more from my readings, because I found the book extremely boring.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">Ken Follet</span>, 864 pages, published the 26th May 2011
by Pan. (978-0330460552)</p>

<p>Like almost every Ken Follet's book, never mind the thickness of the book, starting it implies
	letting everything else aside, getting involved on the stories of its many characters to wake up
	a few days letter, just wanting more, waiting for the next book in the saga.
</p>

<p>This book is a description of an era, the years of the First World War, related not as a political event, 
	or even a historical one, but as a theatrical description of the day by
	day life. And this description is quite long reaching, as it includes the poor and the rich, 
	miners and the ambassadors, soldiers and civilians, bolsheviks and americans.
</p>

<p>It takes no one's part, life becomes so miserable in the German front as on the Allies
	front; if there is some animosity on the author is against the powerful roles -in each of the involved 
	countries-,	whose follies produced the death of millions of people.
</p>

<p>The author performs the usual mix of fiction and reality; but the described events have undergone a 
	proper research. I guess this book would not pass muster as a history book, but for many readers 
	it will definitely provide a motivation to better understand a not so distant war.
</p>

<p>Interesting book, great story, impossible not to praise it.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">Ruth Rendell</span>, 352 pages, published the 4th August 2011
by Arrow. (978-0099550631)</p>

<p>A book with many characters, most getting the focus at some time to develop 
	on their stories, providing for an agreeable read. The book is in fact a mystery one, 
	with two crimes entangled on the main story, but even the 
	murder looks irrelevant, like an accessory to better tell the story of 
	this group of neighbors.</p>

<p>And these stories are very well described, the author almost sets the 
	reader on each character's skin, shame that those personalities look banal at best.

<p>New York story, interesting start, a bit of a drama and some romance, good development, 
	and then the story is suddenly sordid, although, being the book so short, 
	doesn't really get depressing.
</p>

<p>Nice read, in fact, if you are in for a black story; and the end honors the title with its own twist.

<p>By <span class="mark">Julian Fellowes</span>, 352 pages, published the 31st December 2011
by Phoenix. (978-0753827932)</p>

<p>A comedy, a romance, a curious description of another world. 
	And the best is the humor on the writing, the prose on first person mixing fictions and facts. 
	And the critical thinking, short paragraphs where the author starts a reflection on some 
	passage, which I found, for the most part, very interesting.
</p>
<p>The book has a plot, an average romance. But the real argument is the telling of the story, a
	description of a fascinating (that not appealing) world, of its characters, a background to make
	abundant observations in clue of satire.

<p>As a very general rule, most of the Japanese books I have read included some dose of 
  spirituality, of mysticism. Kind of a requirement to explain some outstanding situations.</p>
<p>This novel is just antagonistic: a story definitely abnormal is just explained on the 
   very grounding argument of hallucinogens. Unfortunately, it also makes the story 
   quite poor, with very weak characters. The result is, at best, just creepy.</p>

(reedition) by Voyager (978-0006480419)</p>

<p>So, this is it; a masterpiece, seminal work in the cyberpunk genre, winner of the greatest science fiction prices.</p>

<p>The plotting, the ideas in the book, are superb. In special, because the ideas <span class='mark'>were</span> new in the book.</p>

<p>But the storytelling, is more like story-shaking, like the author was setting so 
   many groundbreaking ideas that they could not be slowly given, becoming quickly 
   a real challenge to follow.</p>
   
<p>It is as incomprehensive as original, and reading it slowly, concentrating on 
   some parts of the plot, only helps uncovering the many holes in the story.</p>
   
<p>I am still unsure if this is a must read, or a must miss. As good as that.</p>

<p>Suspense with a financial background, or perhaps the opposite, a financial story written 
   as a suspense novel. Definitely smart, the novel is very interesting, almost scholar, 
   and the historical ambience perfectly achieved.</p>

<p>Not to be missed.</p>

<p>Great characters, interesting story, and an ingenious plot shape this well developed 
   thriller; and even the ending is unexpected.</p>

<p>It is not perfect; for once, I really disliked the gorey start; and the ending comes 
   too quickly and lets the story a bit orphan, with some naive explanation of the history 
   behind the crimes. Gives the impression of a careful studied plot completed on a rush. 
   But totally recommended.</p>

by Quercus Publishing Plc (978-1849162746)</p>

<p>I read the second part of the trilogy 20 months ago, and I was resisting the urge to buy this 
   last part; but after a couple of bad novels, I was lusting for a good reading time. Didn't 
   let me down, I started it at some slow pace, that got quickly into compulsive mode.</p>

<p>The plot is complete, filling even the few cracks in the previous books. In the whole series, 
   the only part that I find unsatisfactory is the computer hacking: not because is totally 
   impossible to happen, but for the total reliance of the stories on it: the events always 
   reach some impasse, conveniently solved through some convenient PC intrusion. 
   But this complain makes no dent on my impression of the series, indeed fantastic.</p>

<p>The book starts more than promisingly. The first pages are a real pleasure to read, the prose is beautiful.</p>

<p>Soon, the reader -well, me-, starts to question his own intelligence, as the book seems erratic, 
so re-reading pages starts to be the norm. Then, the reader decides an aggressive approach and starts 
questioning the status of the writer, and soon thereafter, stops reading the book.</p>

<p>Slightly ashamed to admit it, I haven't read this book, after 90 minutes of fighting it 
I gave myself a definitive moratory, storing the book on that part of my shelves that 
conforms my particular Hall of Shame. </p>

<p>Obviously, I cannot recommend or criticize it. But take it easy if you go for it.</p>

<p>By <span class="mark">Andrew Ross Sorkin</span>, 640 pages, published the 1st July 2010
by Penguin (978-0141043166)</p>

<p>A total fiction on the big crisis surrounding Lehman Brothers, that is not fiction at all. 
The work done by Andress Ross Sorkin to provide a full scenario for the events described in the 
book is just superb, as to wonder if most of them were just a fictional recreation 
(the notes and sources at the end of the book convinced me that this was not the case).</p>

<p>The book is fascinating, and leads too often to be read as just a novel; for that reason, 
is easy to read it compulsively, missing then the introspection to understand what really 
happened in that crisis. The book described the institutions participating on the chaos, but 
it focused on the people, on the individual characters that shaped it. It does not study the 
economics that originated the crisis -although the steps are perfectly described-, and exposes 
no lessons learnt from the debacle, perhaps because the institutions themselves seem oblivious 
to any such lessons.</p>

<p>As such, is therefore a very interesting relate of the crisis events, and I would 
recommend it to anybody trying to understand why -humanly- this crisis ever happened.</p>

by Counterpoint LLC (978-1582436005)</p>

<p>After 15 months retired from Japanese literature, my return was very disappointing. 
Manazuru is slow, unimaginative, and lacking any of the mystic and magic that I usually 
associate to contemporary Japanese books; not that it doesn't try, it includes its ghost 
that leads the protagonist and intuition seems to be the only driver, but somehow the 
magic is totally missing.</p>

<p>Then, its slowness; not that nothing happens, is more like nothing can happen, 
like any resemblance to have a plot is again the boot itself. So the book is nicely written, 
is easy to read, to enjoy its words, but has no lesson, no end; it is like reading a book 
for the pleasure to see its words coming together. Just not enough.</p>
