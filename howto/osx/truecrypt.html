        <h1>Truecrypt in MacOS silicon</h1>

            <p>I have a bunch of hard disks with Truecryt volumes, and I use a USB 3.0 SATA
                docking station to make them available. I have tried recently Veracrypt, but it
                couldn't open those drives. I didn't want to install yet an unknown executable
                (Veracrypt or Truecrypt) plus MacFuse, etc on my new Mac Mini, so I though on using a Linux virtual
                machine: I had just set one up to access the printer, so why not using it to
                access these drives?
            </p>
            <p>
                So I switched on the USB device, and I added a USB filter to make it accessible
                from my virtual machine. When I insert the harddisk, MacOS will report an error
                that it cannot read the drive: press Eject.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alas, virtualbox is unable to access the USB / disk: Failed to create a proxy
                device for the USB device. (Error: VERR_SHARING_VIOLATION). This requires a
                <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/21218">workaround</a> to work:
            </p>
            <pre>sudo chmod u+s /Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VBoxHeadless</pre>
            <p>
                In Sonoma, this fails because the terminal is prevented from making changes to
                other programs. You need to go to Settings/Privacy & Security/App Management,
                and ensure that Terminal is allowed to update or delete other applications (I
                toggled this on, this the change, and toggle it back off).
                Afterwards, the disk will appear in the virtual machine. In my case, as /dev/sdb
            </p>
            <p>
                Truecrypt is not available in the debian repository, but we can use tcplay instead:
            </p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install tcplay
sudo mkdir /mnt/vm-shared/disk

sudo losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/sdb

sudo tcplay -m container.tc -d /dev/loop0
   <i>Passphrase:
   All ok!</i>
sudo mount -o nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=100 /dev/mapper/container.tc /mnt/vm-shared/disk</pre>

            <p>
                The truecrypt volume is now mounted in the shared folder location, but the host
                cannot see it. The solution I pursued was creating a network share. My first
                attempt was NFS, but we cannot create a NFS share on the mounted truecrypt
                volume either. Samba is possibly a worse solution for this share, but it works
                perfectly:
            </p>
<pre>sudo apt install samba
sudo vi /etc/samba/smb.conf</pre>

            <p>Add the following lines as the end:</p>
<pre>[sambashare]
        comment = Truecrypt share
        path = /mnt/vm-shared/disk
        read only = no
        browsable = yes</pre>

            <p>We restart now samba:</p>
<pre>sudo systemctl restart smbd </pre>

            <p>
                Finally, we need to add the user and enter a password. I use the same user id
                as in MacOS; the password will be saved by MacOS in the keyring, so no need to
                make this fully public.
            </p>
        <pre>sudo smbpasswd -a coderazzi</pre>

    <h2>Automatic truecrypt mounting</h2>

        <p>Now, the interesting thing would be mounting the disk automagically: enter <b>UDEV</b rules.</p>

        <p>We can create a udev rule <b><code>/etc/udev/rules.d/99-truecrypt.rules</code></b> with content:</p>
<pre>SUBSYSTEM=="block", ENV{DEVNAME}=="/dev/sdb", RUN+="/usr/bin/truecrypt_auto.sh"</pre>

        <p>
            The invoked script, <b><code>/usr/bin/truecrypt_auto.sh</code></b> is triggered
            by the udev rule, and a udev rule <a
                href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Udev#Mounting_drives_in_rules">cannot
            invoke mount</a>, but we can use systemd-mount (and systemd-umount) instead. An
            initial version of this script looks like:
        </p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/bash

NAME=container.tc
LOOP=/dev/loop0
DISK=sdb
MOUNT=/mnt/vm-shared/disk
PASSWORD=..........

systemctl stop smbd

umount -q $MOUNT
dmsetup ls | grep $NAME && dmsetup remove $NAME
losetup -l | grep $LOOP && losetup -d $LOOP

lsblk | grep $DISK || exit 0

losetup $LOOP /dev/$DISK
echo $PASSWORD | tcplay -m $NAME -d $LOOP
systemd-mount -o nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000 /dev/mapper/$NAME $MOUNT
systemctl start smbd</pre>

        <p>We need to reload the rules now:</p>
        <pre>udevadm control --reload-rules</pre>

        <p>
            As you can see, there is some code to stop the mounting, and then some code to
            restart it. It can be invoked when the harddisk is added or removed. And it
            only works for <b>ONE</b> hard disk. But not always :-(
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem is that the Linux kernel will not name consistently the device as
            /dev/sdb, even when inserting the same harddisk. As far as I can see, it
            switches, at least,  between /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc. Fortunately, udev rules
            support some regex matching, and we can pass parameters to the underlying
            script; let's change the
            <b><code>/etc/udev/rules.d/99-truecrypt.rules</code></b> rule into:
        </p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/bash

[ -z "$1" ] && echo Missing disk parameter && exit 1

NAME=container.tc
LOOP=/dev/loop0
DEV_DISK=$1
DISK=$(echo $DEV_DISK | cut -d/ -f3)
MOUNT=/mnt/vm-shared/disk
PASSWORD=.............

systemctl stop smbd

systemd-umount -q $MOUNT
dmsetup ls | grep $NAME && dmsetup remove $NAME
losetup -l | grep $LOOP && losetup -d $LOOP

lsblk | grep $DISK || exit 0

losetup $LOOP $DEV_DISK
echo $PASSWORD | tcplay -m $NAME -d $LOOP
systemd-mount -o nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000 /dev/mapper/$NAME $MOUNT
systemctl start smbd</pre>

        <p>We need to reload the rules again:</p>
        <pre>udevadm control --reload-rules</pre>

        <p>
            This works quite consistently for me: I can stop, restart the USB device,
            change the inserted hard disk, and the volume is mounted as expected.
            Occasionally, the share volume appears empty, and the log files show an error
            such as:
        </p>
<pre>Unit mnt-vm\x2dshared-disk.mount was already loaded or has a fragment file.
Job for smbd.service canceled.</pre>

        <p>
            This overall approach works as well if the Truecrypt volumes are directly USB
            drives (instead of hard disks inserted into a USB docking station), but then I
            would need to create a USB filter in virtualbox for each of them.
        </p><p>
            To use with the docker station hard disks that have no truecrypt volumes, I
            just need to stop first the virtual machine, so that the filter in Virtualbox
            does not apply.
        </p><p>
            The part that I dislike here is the unmounting process: the UDEV rule is
            triggered when the hard disk is ejected (or the USB station switched off), so I
            could lose information that I have written to the volume. The way that
            Truecrypt works, this won't be a problem if the network operation (as it is via
            Samba) is well completed and you let some minor time for any buffering to
            complete. So: after writing anything in the volume, do not rush to switch it
            off!
