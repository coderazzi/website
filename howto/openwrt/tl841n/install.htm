<h1>OpenWRT on TL-WR841N</h1>

<p>
    The <a href='http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd'>OpenWRT documentation</a> for this device is not bad: the most important point is to detect the hardware version of the device (8.2 in my case), and find the associated information -which at the moment does not exist-. But by checking the documentation on other existing versions, is easy to follow some hints and download and install the correct version.
</p>

<h2>First naive install</h2>

<p>
    I discovered that my version was 8.2 and after some wandering I downloaded the most updated version: <a href='http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v8-squashfs-factory.bin'>http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v8-squashfs-factory.bin</a>, and installed it via the basic firmware upgrade in the original web interface from TP-Link.
</p>

<p>
    On reboot, I was unable to access the original web interface in <span class='mark'>192.168.1.1</span>, but a telnet <span class='mark'>192.168.1.1</span> quickly allowed entering the console terminal. As soon as a password in provided, telnet is disabled and ssh got enabled.
</p>

<p>
    <span class='mark'>LUCI</span> is the package required to include a web interface, which is installed in pseudo debian style:
</p>

<pre>opkg update
opkg install luci
/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable
/etc/init.d/uhttpd start</pre>

<p>
    Once the uhttpd daemon is running, accessing <span class='mark'>http://192.168.1.1</span> on the web browser renders already some useful web pages to reconfigure the router. Time to install now openvpn:</p>
     <pre>opkg install openvpn</pre>

<p>
    But this fails. No such package available; the alternative is to install <span class='mark'>openvpn-nossl</span> (or the ssl variant), but it is just too much for this router: <span class='mark'>it only has 4 Mb flash memory, and that is barely enough for openWrt</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Uninstalling LUCI is still insufficient. But there is an alternative: to compile openpnv support directly into the image (installing packages afterwards take much more memory, as the image is kept compressed on memory). Fortunately, the OpenWRT people has done a great job at simplifying the compilation and creation of new images (and the documentation is in fact very good).
</p>


<h2><a id='build'>Build own OpenWRT image</a></h2>

<p>
    To compile the image, it is needed a case sensitive file system, so I did the compilation in Linux, following mostly the information found on the <a href='http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build'>OpenWrt wiki</a> and on this <a href='http://debblog.philkern.de/2012/10/how-to-maintain-openwrt-installation.html'>blog entry</a>.
</p>

<pre>#get the source code
svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/attitude_adjustment

cd attitude_adjustment

#update feeds (information on available source code)
./scripts/feeds update -a

#include openpnv
./scripts/feeds install openvpn

#select packages to include on the image
make menuconfig
    #Target system: Atheros AR7xxx/AR9xxx
    #Subtarget: generic
    #Target profile: TP-LINK TL-WR841ND/N
    #Network: choose VPN, then openvpn AND openvpn-easy-rsa (both *, not just M)
    #ensure that in kernel modulkes, chriptography, kmdo-crypto-manager is selected

#produce now the configuration file
make defconfig

#compile it
make -j 5 #on a N ore machine, use N+1</pre>

<p>
    Done, the image is created; it is possible -and recommendable- to list the differences with the default configuration, by doing:
</p>

<pre>./scripts/diffconfig.sh > customConfig</pre>

<p>
    My customConfig file looks like:
</p>

<pre>CONFIG_TARGET_ar71xx=y
CONFIG_TARGET_ar71xx_generic=y
CONFIG_TARGET_ar71xx_generic_TLWR841=y
CONFIG_OPENVPN_DISABLE_EUREPHIA=y
CONFIG_OPENVPN_DISABLE_MANAGEMENT=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-crypto-hash=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-crypto-manager=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-ledtrig-usbdev=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-nls-base=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-tun=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-usb-core=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-usb-ohci=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_kmod-usb2=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_liblzo=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_libopenssl=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_openssl-util=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_openvpn=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_openvpn-easy-rsa=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_uboot-ar71xx-nbg460n_550n_550nh=y
CONFIG_PACKAGE_zlib=y</pre>

<p>
    As this <a href='http://debblog.philkern.de/2012/10/how-to-maintain-openwrt-installation.html'>blog entry</a> explains: to update later the image, get the new defconfig, append the customConfig file to .config and run make oldconfig.
</p>

<p>
    The process above creates the images in <span class='mark'>bin/ar71xx</span>. I needed to load fully the image, so I required the file <span class='mark'>openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wr841n-v8-squashfs-factory.bin</span>. Note: as you can see, this image takes already almost the full 4 Mb available in this device!
</p>

<p>
    Time to update again the router's firmware, now <a href='http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.uninstall'>from the command line</a>. The first point is to upload the image to the router (I did it running a web server using <span class='mark'>node.js</span> on my images directory, then using <span class='mark'>wget</span>), and afterwards enter:
</p>

<pre>mtd -r write /tmp/new_image.bin firmware</pre>

<p>   
    Done! Router ready to go purely barebones with just openvpn built in; no web access at all. Before setting up openvpn, I <a href='vlans.htm'>changed the configuration</a> to have multiple vlans.
</p>
